FOR THE POPUP: JUST MAKE IT AN IFRAME OPTION FOR THE CUSTOM LINKS

options: change the right most column to just a list of links to resources, follow by the most recent blog post



- [x] in quoteReminders.js, need to make the askForOverride function

- [x] Update how storage functions, maybe rework it if possible
test to make sure all the settings still work
- [ ] Options page re-work
    - [ ] fix the way options work
    - [x] Better design
    - [ ] Change font (probably just package a font with the extension)
    - [ ] Import the .MD-to-.HTML font, and then just copy-and-paste the HTML into there
- [ ] Features to add:
    - [ ] Clear up blank space while editing a ticket
    - [x] change text of tracing number to akko claim number
    - [x] Up to three custom links
    - [x] click extension icon to go to settings page
    - [ ] label bottom of pattern drawer instead of top
    - [ ] when part is attached to a ticket, turn it into a hyperlink to the cpr.parts page (editable url though)
    - [ ] alternating bg color on part search results
    - [ ] reminders to add customers to sale and tradein tickets
    - [x] Bold dates of tickets that are due today
    - [ ] "Device not present" quick override
    - [ ] "All fail" quick preset and "all pass" quick preset, or add default values
    - [ ] Highlight which repair selection hasn't been made
    - [ ] Add an optional tech-only section which doesn't print out. Has completely custom options for whether accessorries and insurance has been offered, etc.
    - [ ] maybe you can make the click targets bigger by making them spill out over the text and making them react to hover
    - [ ] Also add “not testable” option to the percentage
    - [ ] Add a message describing what is happening in the default JSON object, so if someone without the extension pulls it up, they can see what’s happening
    - [ ] Change the pre-tests to a form so you can tab-space through them (or don't if there's a quick override)
- [ ] test - what happens when you try to edit a saved form when you’ve made changes to the template after initially submitting the form?



- [ ] Fixes:
    - [ ] Scaling on pattern drawer
    - [ ] Links and probably other settings are wiping every time you open the options page
    - [ ] Change the price to pull from the total, so if anything has been paid already, the actual total will still show

- [ ] Make better settings page and update log
- [ ] Make a new video
- [ ] Publish to Chrome
