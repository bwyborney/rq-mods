FOR THE POPUP: JUST MAKE IT AN IFRAME OPTION FOR THE CUSTOM LINKS

I'm over in the m2h files, writing the example 6 folder which is everything that's gonna go on my website.
I need to finish the features page with a list of upcoming features
I then need to make the instructions page 
I need to finish the TOC/navbar so that the instructions page will be somewhat usable
I then need to make the feedback/contact page
Then I need tomake you tube videos (one showing what RQ Mods can do and one showing how to set it up) - every time I add a new feature, that will get its own video
    version 2 coming soon, bunch of new features and new design and the storage bug is fixed forever
    Also there will be a donate button
Then in the options.html page, I need to link to:
    The instructions
    The list of features
    I need to include the latest blog post page
    Also the video
    Then I need to link to other extensions
    I need to link to other extensions in my blog pages as well
    Those extensions need their own little websites too
I'll need to link to these resources from my chrome web store listing pages
If I can make a poll element, that would be sweet because I could figure out if people want other browsers


- [x] in quoteReminders.js, need to make the askForOverride function

- [x] Update how storage functions, maybe rework it if possible
test to make sure all the settings still work
- [ ] Options page re-work
    - [ ] fix the way options work
    - [x] Better design
    - [ ] Change font (probably just package a font with the extension)
    - [ ] Import the .MD-to-.HTML font, and then just copy-and-paste the HTML into there
- [ ] Features to add:
    - [ ] Clear up blank space while editing a ticket
    - [x] change text of tracing number to akko claim number
    - [x] Up to three custom links
    - [x] click extension icon to go to settings page
    - [ ] label bottom of pattern drawer instead of top
    - [ ] when part is attached to a ticket, turn it into a hyperlink to the cpr.parts page (editable url though)
    - [ ] alternating bg color on part search results
    - [ ] reminders to add customers to sale and tradein tickets
    - [x] Bold dates of tickets that are due today
    - [ ] "Device not present" quick override
    - [ ] "All fail" quick preset and "all pass" quick preset, or add default values
    - [ ] Highlight which repair selection hasn't been made
    - [ ] Add an optional tech-only section which doesn't print out. Has completely custom options for whether accessorries and insurance has been offered, etc.
    - [ ] maybe you can make the click targets bigger by making them spill out over the text and making them react to hover
    - [ ] Also add “not testable” option to the percentage
    - [ ] Add a message describing what is happening in the default JSON object, so if someone without the extension pulls it up, they can see what’s happening
    - [ ] Change the pre-tests to a form so you can tab-space through them (or don't if there's a quick override)
- [ ] test - what happens when you try to edit a saved form when you’ve made changes to the template after initially submitting the form?



- [ ] Fixes:
    - [ ] Scaling on pattern drawer
    - [ ] Links and probably other settings are wiping every time you open the options page
    - [ ] Change the price to pull from the total, so if anything has been paid already, the actual total will still show

- [ ] Make better settings page and update log
- [ ] Make a new video
- [ ] Publish to Chrome
